# Wildlife Safety App Fixes - COMPLETED

## Issue: App shows old version with basic model when running standalone

### Root Cause:
1. Model file inconsistency - two .tflite files causing confusion
2. Caching issues with React Native bundler  
3. Java version compatibility issues

### Steps Completed:

✅ Removed unused model file (snake_classifier.tflite)
✅ Verified labels.txt matches snake_model.tflite output (6 snake species)
✅ Added comprehensive debug logging to ImageClassifierModule
✅ Updated JAVA_HOME to JDK 21
✅ Cleared React Native cache and rebuilt
✅ Built debug APK successfully (app-debug.apk: 209MB)
✅ Verified method name consistency (classifyImage matches JS call)

### Key Findings:
- Assets directory contains correct files: snake_model.tflite and labels.txt
- labels.txt contains 6 snake species: Common Indian Krait, Green Vine Snake, Hump-nosed pit viper, Indian Cobra, Python, Russell-s Viper
- class_names.json contains broader wildlife classification (likely for online mode)
- Method names are consistent between Java/Kotlin and JavaScript
- Build completed successfully with Java 21 compatibility

### Files Modified:
- android/app/src/main/java/com/wildlifesafety/ImageClassifierModule.kt
- android/gradle.properties (Java version config)
- Removed android/app/src/main/assets/snake_classifier.tflite

### Next Steps for Testing:
1. Install the new APK on device/emulator
2. Test image classification functionality
3. Verify debug logs show correct model loading
4. Test both online and offline modes
5. Confirm only snake species are identified (6 classes)
6. Monitor debug output for model initialization and classification

### APK Location:
android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

The app should now load the correct snake_model.tflite and show proper debug logging to help identify any remaining issues.
